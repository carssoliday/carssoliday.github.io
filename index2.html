	<hr>
	<p> Good morning. My name is Carson Soliday and today I am going to be explaining to you
	some of my favorite things. I believe all of these things make me who I am. I am a unique individual
	with likes and dislikes and without this project, you would probably know none of these things. I will be 
	discussing my favorite shows, foods, colors, animals, and most importantly, my music. </p> 
	<hr>
	<p> To begin, I will talk to you about my favorite shows. Netflix has always been a safe place for me 
	and I can say without a doubt that the best show ever created is a tie between New Girl and the Office. New girl 
	is a quality show about a girl who moves in with 4 male roommates. The Office follows several employees working at 
	a paper company. Both are funny and heartfelt, which is what I love. I love watching these shows with my dad and brother. </p>
	<hr> 
	<p> Next, I will discuss my favorite color and animal. My favorite color is green. I was born with magnificent green eyes 
	that border on an aquamarine color. They are beautiful in my opinion and one of my best features. I love green shoes, water bottles, 
	green accessories, and more. My favorite animal is a bit odd, but I love hippos. They are so big and loveable and even though they are violent
	they are still my favorite animal.</p>
	<hr>
	<p> To conclude, I will talk about my music taste. I would say my music taste balances between Indie and Rock. I love a good fem band
	but also adore acoustic guitar and sensitive music. Some bands and artists I love are Cage the Elephant, Tame Impala, Phoebe Bridgers, Taylor Swift,
	and paramore. I play guitar and piano and love to sing all the time. If I didn't have music I would not be myself. Thank you for reading! </p>
